    <p class="desc"><em><font face = "Georgia"size="4">Around me, I noticed a very different Tehran from the one I’d been used to.</p> <p>An influx of new, shamelessly luxurious condos had replaced the charming little houses I was familiar with.</p><p> New roads, new highways, hordes of invasive SUVs. Large billboards with advertisements for Swiss-made watches and Korean flat screen TVs. Women in colorful scarves and manteaus, men with dyed</p><p> hair and beards, and hundreds of charming cafes with hip western music and female staff.</p><p> They were the kinds of changes that creep up on people; the kind you only really notice once normal life gets taken away from you.</p><p>
Two weeks later, I began writing again. Some friends agreed to let me start a blog as part of their arts magazine.</p><p> I called it Ketabkhan — it means book-reader in Persian.</p>
<p>Six years was a long time to be in jail, but it’s an entire era online.</p><p> Writing on the internet itself had not changed, but reading — or, at least, getting things read — had altered dramatically.</p><p> I’d been told how essential social networks had become while I’d been gone, and so I knew one thing: If I wanted to lure people to see my writing, I had to use social media now.</p>
<p>So I tried to post a link to one of my stories on Facebook. </p><p>Turns out Facebook didn’t care much. It ended up looking like a boring classified ad. No description. No image. Nothing. It got three likes. Three! That was it.
