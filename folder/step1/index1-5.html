An influx of new, <big><big><big>shamelessly</big></big></big> luxurious condos had replaced the charming little houses I was familiar with. New roads, new highways, hordes of <big><big><big>invasive</big></big></big> SUVs. Large billboards with advertisements for Swiss-made watches and Korean flat screen TVs. Women in colorful scarves and manteaus, men with dyed hair and beards, and hundreds of charming cafes with hip western music and female staff. They were the kinds of changes that creep up on people; the kind you only really notice once normal life gets <big><big><big>taken</big></big></big> away from you.
Two weeks later, I began writing again. Some friends agreed to let me start a blog as part of their arts magazine. I called it Ketabkhan *** it means book-reader in Persian.
Six years was a long time to be in jail, but it’s an <big><big><big>entire</big></big></big> era online. Writing on the internet itself had not changed, but reading **** or, at least, getting things read **** had altered <big><big><big>dramatically</big></big></big>. I’d been told how essential social networks had become while I’d been gone, and so I knew one thing: If I wanted to lure people to see my writing, <big><big><big>I had</big></big></big> to use social media now.
So I tried to post a link to one of my stories on Facebook. Turns out Facebook didn’t care much. It ended up looking like a boring classified ad. <big><big><big><em>

    <li>Nothing.</li>
    <li>It got three likes.</li>
    <li>Three! That was it.</li>
