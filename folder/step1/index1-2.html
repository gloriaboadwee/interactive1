      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me,<br /></h1>
    <p class="desc"> I noticed a very <strong>different</strong> Tehran from the one I’d been used to. An influx of new, shamelessly luxurious <center><h2>c<br />o<br />n<br />d<br />o<br />s<br /></h2></center> had replaced the charming <small>little houses</small> I was familiar with. New roads, new highways, hordes of invasive <strong><big>SUVs</big></strong>. Large billboards with advertisements for Swiss-made watches and Korean flat screen TVs. Women in colorful scarves and manteaus, men with dyed hair and beards, and <strong>hundreds</strong> of charming cafes with hip western music and female staff. They were the kinds of changes that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c&nbsp;r&nbsp;e&nbsp;e&nbsp;p&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; up on people; the kind you only really notice once normal life <em><strong>gets&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you<br /></em></strong>
Two weeks later, I began writing again. Some friends agreed to let me start a blog as part of their arts magazine. I called it <em>Ketabkhan</em> — it means book-reader in Persian.
Six years was a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time to be in jail, but it’s an entire <strong><big>era</strong></big> online. Writing on the internet itself had not changed, but reading <em>— or, at least, getting things read —</em> had altered dramatically. I’d been told how <strong>essential</strong> social networks had become while I’d been gone, and so I knew one thing: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<big>If I wanted to lure people to see my writing, I had to use social media now.</big>
<center><br />So I tried to post a link to one of my stories on Facebook. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turns out Facebook didn’t care much.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It ended up looking like a boring classified ad.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <strong>No description. <br />No image.<br /> Nothing. <br />It got three likes. <br />Three!<br /> That was it.</center></strong>
